\begin{frame}[fragile]{Convex Hull Definition}
  \begin{defn}
    A set is $S$ is \emph{convex} if for any two points $p_1, p_2 \in S$ the line
    between them lies entirely in $S$. The \emph{convex hull} of a finite point set
    $V$ is the smallest convex set which contains $V$.
  \end{defn}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Convex Hull Descriptions}
  Convex hulls can be described uniquely in multiple ways

  \begin{itemize}
  \item By their set of vertices.
  \item By a system of inequalities.
  \end{itemize}

  These properties make convex hulls computationally ``nice''. That is, they are
  easy for a computer to describe them and there exists algorithms to go between
  these descriptions. This cannot be said about most other geometric structures.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Where to Find Convex Hulls}
  Convex hulls play a very important role in computational geometry hence scientific
  computations. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Optimization over a set of linear constraints.
  \item Intersections of bezier curves.
  \item The state space of any quantum system.
  \item Approximations of spheres.
  \end{itemize}
