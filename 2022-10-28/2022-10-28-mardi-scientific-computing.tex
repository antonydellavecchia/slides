\section{Convex Hulls}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Definition}
  \begin{defn}
    A set is $S$ is \emph{convex} if for any two points $p_1, p_2 \in S$ the line
    between them lies entirely in $S$. The \emph{convex hull} of a finite point set
    $V$ is the smallest convex set which contains $V$.
  \end{defn}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Convex Hull descriptions}
  Convex hulls can be described uniquely in multiple ways

  \begin{itemize}
  \item By their set of vertices.
  \item By a system of inequalities.
  \end{itemize}

  These properties make convex hulls computationally ``nice''. That is, they are
  easy for a computer to describe them and there exists algorithms to go between
  these descriptions. This cannot be said about most other geometric structures.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Where to find convex hulls}
  Convex hulls play a very important role in computational geometry hence scientific
  computations. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Optimization over a set of linear constraints.
  \item Intersections of bezier curves.
  \item The state space of any quantum system.
  \item Graphics.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polarity and Duality}
  \begin{theorem}
    Let $P \subset \R^n$ be an $n$ polytope with $0 \in \text{int}P$ then
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $(P^o)^o = P$
    \item For any point $p$ on the boundary of $P$, $H = \set{x \in \R^n
      \mid \langle p, x \rangle = 1}$ is a supporting hyperplane of $P^o$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{remark}
    If $0 \in \text{int} P$, where $P = \bigcap_{i=1}^m H_i^+$, then we can write
    $H_i^+ = [1:-h_1^{(i)}: \dots: -h_n^{(i)}]$, then $P^o = \text{conv}(h_1, \dots, h_n)$.
    So, finding a half-space description of $P^o$ will give us the vertices of $P$.
    So we can reduce the problem of finding a $\V$-description from an $\mathcal{H}$-description
    to a convex hull computation.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A basic Algorithm}
  
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    Input: Finite point set $V \subset \R^n$ with dimension of $\text{aff}V = n$\\
    Output: Finite set of half-spaces $H_i^+$ such that $\text{conv}(V) =
    \cap_{i=1}^m H_i^+$
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \STATE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \emptyset$
      \FOR{each $n$ element subset $W \subset V$ with dimension aff$W = n-1$ }
      \STATE $H \leftarrow \text{aff} W$
      \IF{$V \subset H^+$}
      \STATE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \mathcal{H} \cup H^+$
      \ELSE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \mathcal{H} \cup H^-$
      \ENDIF
      \ENDFOR
      \RETURN $\mathcal{H}$

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Worst Case Example}
  \begin{defn}
    The \emph{moment curve} $\mu_n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as
    $\tau \to (\tau, \dots, \tau^n)$. A polytope is called \emph{cyclic}
    if it is the convex hull of points on the moment curve.
  \end{defn}
  \begin{remark}
    Notice that since any $n + 1$ vertices lie in a distinct supporting
    hyperplane, that the number of facets is maximal given a fixed point
    of number vertices. So the worst case for any convex hull computation
    is $\Theta(m^{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor }})$.
  
  \end{remark}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Partitioning Lemma}
  \begin{lemma}
    Let $V_0, V_+, V_-$ be the partition of a point set $V$,defined by
    $V_0 = V \cap H, V_+ = V \cap H^+ \setminus H, V_- = V \cap H^- \setminus H$
    where $H$ is a hyperplane. Then we have $P \cap H =
    \text{conv}(V_0 \cup V_+ \cup \set{[v, w] \cap H \mid v \in V_+ , w \in V_-})$
