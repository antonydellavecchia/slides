\begin{frame}[fragile]{MaRDI}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Develop a mathematical research data infrastructure.
  \item Set standards for confirmable workflows and certified mathematical research data.
  \item Provide services to both the mathematical and wider scientific community.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why Files?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item People often have a preferred software system. \pause
  \item Computations can be expensive. \pause
  \item Verification of results is at most as computationally expensive.\pause
  \item Software changes often.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Storing Mathematical Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It's common to have multiple perspectives on an object in mathematics. \pause
    \item While storing mathematical data a choice of perspective must me made. \pause
    \end{itemize}

  Say we want to store:
  \begin{align*}
    p(x, y, z) = xy - z^2
  \end{align*} \pause

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some technicalities with the coefficients.
  \item Is x considered as a coefficient of y?
