\begin{document}
Due to the complexity of mathematical objects, storing data so it is FAIR has its challenges.
We describe a generic \texttt{JSON} based file format which is suitable for computations in computer algebra,
highlighting some design decisions and demonstrating some of the benefits with an emphasis on interoperability and reproducibility.
This is implemented in the computer algebra system \texttt{OSCAR}, but we also show how it can be used in a different context.
