\begin{frame}[fragile]{Storing Computer Algebra Data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item It's common to have multiple perspectives on an object in mathematics. 
    \item While storing mathematical data a choice of perspective must me made.
    \item Such a choice might not be describeable in an email.
    \end{itemize}

  Say we want to store:
  \begin{align*}
    p = 2y^3z^4 + (\bold{a} + 3)z^2 + 5\bold{a}y + 1
  \end{align*} \pause

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some technicalities with the coefficients.
  \item Is y considered a coefficient of z?
  \item What is $\bold{a}$?
  \item How can we guarantee the objects behave as expected on load?
  \end{itemize}
