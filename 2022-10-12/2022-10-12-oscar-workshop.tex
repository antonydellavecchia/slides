\section{Preliminaries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Hulls}
  \begin{defn}
    Let $A \subset \mathbb{K}^n$, an \emph{affine combination} of points in $A$
    is a linear combination $\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_m a_m$ where $\lambda_m \in
    \mathbb{K}$ and $a \in A$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_m = 1$. The
    \emph{affine hull} is the set of all such combinations.
  \end{defn}

    \begin{defn}
    Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a \emph{convex combination} of points in $A$
    is an affine combination $\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_m a_m$ where $\lambda_m \geq
    0$. The  \emph{convex hull} is the set of all such combinations.
  \end{defn}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polytopes}
  \begin{defn}
    A set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a \emph{polytope} if it can be described
    as the convex hull of finitely many points. The dimension of $P$ is
    defined to be the dimension of it's affine hull. A \emph{$k$-polytope} is a
    k dimensional polytope. A \emph{$k$-simplex} is the convex hull of $k + 1$
    affine independant points.
  \end{defn}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Faces}
  \begin{defn}
    Given an n-polytope $P \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, the intersection $P \cap H$
    with a supporting hyperplane $H$ is called a \emph{proper face}. A face of
    dimension $k$ is called a $k$ face, a 0-face is a vertex, 1-face an edge,
    n-2 face a ridge and an n-1 face a facet.
  \end{defn}
  \begin{remark}
    Proper faces are also polytopes with respect to their affine hull.
  \end{remark}
  \begin{theorem}
    The boundary of a full dimesional polytope is the union of all it's
    proper faces.
  \end{theorem}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Half-spaces}
  \begin{defn}
    Given an affine hyperplane $H \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ given in homegeneous
    coordinates as $[a_0, \dots, a_n]$, define the \emph{positive halfspace}
    $H^+$ as $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid a_0 + a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n \geq 0 \}$.
  \end{defn}

  \begin{remark}
    For each facet $f$ of a polytope $P$, there exists a positive halfspace $H^+$
    such that $f = P \cap H$ and $ P \subset H^+$
  \end{remark}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polytope Descriptions}
  \begin{theorem}
    Let $H_i$ be the supporting hyperplanes for the facets of a polytope $P$.
    then $P = \cap_i^m H_i^+$
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{theorem}
    Every polytope is the convex hull of it's vertices
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{remark}
    We call $P =  \text{conv}(v_1, \dots, v_m)$ a $\mathcal{V}$-description, and
    we call $P =  \cap_{i=1}^kH_i^+$ an $\mathcal{H}$-description. An algorithm
    that finds a $\V$-description from an $\mathcal{H}$-description is referred to as a convex
    hull computation. We call the pair ${\V, \mathcal{H} }$ a double description of $P$.
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polarity and Duality}
  \begin{defn}
    Given a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ define the polar set as
    $X^o = \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x_1y_1 + \dots x_ny_n \leq 1\}$
  \end{defn}
  \begin{theorem}
    If $P \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an $n$-polytope with $0 \in \text{int}P$ then
    $P^o$ is also an $n$-polytope, and for $V$ the vertex set of $P$ we have
    \begin{center}
      $P^o = \bigcap_{v \in V} \set{y \in \R^n \mid \langle v, y \rangle \leq 1} = \bigcap_{v \in V} [1: -v_0: \dots : -v_n]^+$
    \end{center}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.30\textwidth, height=0.4\textheight]{images/polar}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Polarity and Duality}
  \begin{theorem}
    Let $P \subset \R^n$ be an $n$ polytope with $0 \in \text{int}P$ then
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $(P^o)^o = P$
    \item For any point $p$ on the boundary of $P$, $H = \set{x \in \R^n
      \mid \langle p, x \rangle = 1}$ is a supporting hyperplane of $P^o$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{remark}
    If $0 \in \text{int} P$, where $P = \bigcap_{i=1}^m H_i^+$, then we can write
    $H_i^+ = [1:-h_1^{(i)}: \dots: -h_n^{(i)}]$, then $P^o = \text{conv}(h_1, \dots, h_n)$.
    So, finding a half-space description of $P^o$ will give us the vertices of $P$.
    So we can reduce the problem of finding a $\V$-description from an $\mathcal{H}$-description
    to a convex hull computation.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A basic Algorithm}
  
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    Input: Finite point set $V \subset \R^n$ with dimension of $\text{aff}V = n$\\
    Output: Finite set of half-spaces $H_i^+$ such that $\text{conv}(V) =
    \cap_{i=1}^m H_i^+$
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \STATE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \emptyset$
      \FOR{each $n$ element subset $W \subset V$ with dimension aff$W = n-1$ }
      \STATE $H \leftarrow \text{aff} W$
      \IF{$V \subset H^+$}
      \STATE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \mathcal{H} \cup H^+$
      \ELSE $\mathcal{H} \leftarrow \mathcal{H} \cup H^-$

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Worst Case Example}
  \begin{defn}
    The \emph{moment curve} $\mu_n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as
    $\tau \to (\tau, \dots, \tau^n)$. A polytope is called \emph{cyclic}
    if it is the convex hull of points on the moment curve.
  \end{defn}
  \begin{remark}
    Notice that since any $n + 1$ vertices lie in a distinct supporting
    hyperplane, that the number of facets is maximal given a fixed point
    of number vertices. So the worst case for any convex hull computation
    is $\Theta(m^{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor }})$.

    Let $V_0, V_+, V_-$ be the partition of a point set $V$,defined by
    $V_0 = V \cap H, V_+ = V \cap H^+ \setminus H, V_- = V \cap H^- \setminus H$
    where $H$ is a hyperplane. Then we have $P \cap H =
    \text{conv}(V_0 \cup V_+ \cup \set{[v, w] \cap H \mid v \in V_+ , w \in V_-})$
